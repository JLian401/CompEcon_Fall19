    "# Numerical Optimization in Python\n",
    "### by [Jason DeBacker](https://jasondebacker.com), September 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook illustrates how to do numerical optimization in Python using the SciPy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The minimization problem\n",
    "The general formulation of a nonlinear optimization problem can be written as,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}} : f(x) \\quad\\text{s.t}\\quad g(x)\\geq 0 \\quad\\text{and}\\quad h(x) = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is a nonlinear function of variables $x$, subject to the inequality constraints $g$ and the equality constraints $h$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Example: Minimizing Average Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the total cost function $C(x) = a + bx + cx^2$ where output $x \\geq 0$ and $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive constants.  Average cost is thus given by $AC(x) = ax^{-1} + b + cx$.  Thus the minimization problem here is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} : f(x) \\quad\\text{s.t}\\quad x\\geq 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step will be to declare this average cost function so that we can reference it in our minimization routine."

    "With this function we can solve for the minimum analytically.  Taking the derivate of the average cost function and setting it equal to 0 we find that average cost is minimized a $x^{*} = \\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$.  $x = -\\left(\\frac{a}{c}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ also solves the necessary condition, but since $a$, $b$, $c$ are positive, $x^{*}$ is the only non-negative solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at this function.  To do this, we'll want to import Matplotlib, a packge that allows for some plotting of data.  Including below the import of this package is a magic command to print the Matplotlib plots inline in this notebook."

    "[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) is the leading package for scientific computing in Python.  SciPy offers a great deal, but what we are interested in here are the numerical optimization tools provided by SciPy.  These tools are in the `scipy.optimize` submodule.  This submodule includes rootfinders through `scipy.optimize.root` and minimizers through `scipy.optimize.minimize`.\n",

    "The `minimize` method offers a number of methods for numerical optimization.  These include several we've discussed in class including the Newton's method, BFGS, Nelder-Meade, Powell's method, and others.  Scipy also offers minimizers specifically for scalar functions in `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`.  This includes methods for scalar minimization that we discussed such as Brent's method and golden ratio search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call a minimizer and see how it works - and whether we get the answer we know we should.  We'll first illustrate using a scalar minimzer and then the more general `scipy.optimize.minimize`."
